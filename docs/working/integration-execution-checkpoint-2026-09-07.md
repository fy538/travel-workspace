# Integration execution checkpoint — 2026-09-07

This note records the next controlled integration tranche after the
request-to-root fixture. It is an execution receipt, not a new product
architecture or a production-activation decision.

## Landed

### Retained Opening context is an exact Moment dependency

Backend merge commit `7d9f85488` (`fix: admit retained opening context through
moment reads`) changes Source-contribution value candidates so an Opening
resource is read by `moment.read`, while retained Source resources continue to
be read by `source.inspect`. The compiler now admits the exact `opening`
resource kind for Moment reads. The owner-admission tests exercise Home and
Places for an active Opening and suppress the contribution when that Opening
changes, is dismissed, or expires.

This keeps the dependency graph honest: a retained Source does not borrow
current Opening state, and a failed optional Moment read cannot silently turn
an old context into a current claim.

### Optional Places reads have physical admission bounds

Backend merge commit `5a1b8e493` (`bound optional blocking read admission`)
adds a semaphore around the existing optional Places blocking executor. A
queued timeout or cancellation marks its work item as cancelled but holds the
permit until that physical item drains. Repeated root deadlines therefore
fail closed instead of accumulating unbounded executor work. Submission
failure releases the permit, and running work still has its existing late
outcome handling.

This is an operational safety correction to the existing owner-read boundary;
it adds no provider, scheduler, durable watch, or new root workload.

## Verification

From `travel-agent`, the combined owner-read, Source, root, practical, exact
request, and optional Places suite passed:

```text
259 passed in 7.77s
```

The suite includes the HTTP/storage request→worker→readback fixture, exact
Home/Places receiving, public/retained Source admission, practical opening
assessment, canonical owner reads, root composition, JSONB digest identity,
and executor saturation/cancellation. It uses local authored fixtures and
does not claim provider or paid-model coverage.

## Deliberate non-goals

* `route.evaluate` remains unavailable to the canonical owner-read mesh. The
  existing `RouteFact`, movement, and leave-by specialists remain scoped
  foreground capabilities; no generic route owner or background location
  permission was invented.
* Source worker/provider activation remains dark. A successful fixture proves
  lifecycle and receiving contracts, not production supply, cost, or user
  usefulness.
* No Chat redesign, Life migration, native screen, or generated API contract
  was changed in this tranche.
* The current workspace still contains concurrent uncommitted strategy,
  design, OpenAPI, and concierge changes. They were intentionally not staged
  or folded into this receipt.

## Next checkpoint

Reassess CV-2 checkpoint 2 against actual owner-to-consumer cases: a practical
fact should change the dependent Home/Places claim while the independent saved,
editorial, social, or historical material survives. Only if a concrete timing
question appears in that portfolio should we design the next explicit
RouteFact/movement adapter. Keep provider activation and native acceptance as
separate gates.
